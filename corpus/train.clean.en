&quot; Hello Every &quot; is really grammatically correct , logically because of a crazy rule of an expression source .
Plato dies , which follows logically because he is human .
Hey James , by what logic are you not really familiar with me ?
You believe that it is grammatically correct by what logic ?
It &apos;s probably a person . However , not logically entailing Peter &apos;s expression ...
Your being obliged to wear pants doesn &apos;t logically follow from the state of your being a man .
Because of that , nothing lojbanic is expressed .
You don &apos;t attend , you pay attention , under the typical logic .
One times one is one , according to mathematics .
I leave motivated by computer gaming and sleeping with my beloved .
Why do you ask ?

Regardless of that reason , I defend the noble Lojban language against word-shape crimes .
Apparently , the computer compels me to not see the interesting discussion .
I hit the ball forcing it to roll down from the top of the hill .
The guy starts being on top of the girl and experiences his penis being soft .
Reply me via mail only when you read and understand this .
While standing up , I say that the eating is over .
You enter , with the key word being a requirement .
Please stand at the stairs . This is a prerequisit for me to defend you .
I go to the office as required by my work .
The experience of a looping discussion in all languages which results in nothing is the cause .
Regardless of this , I am not able to sleep .
I become a pear because I eat pears .
I walk because I don &apos;t have a car .
I walk , but not because I don &apos;t own a car .
I walk regardless of whether or not I own a car .

I enjoy the wisdom of Socrates , which was the basis for Plato .
As an authority on such things , how can you describe the typical Lojban-enthusiast ?

Being a soldier is my job , where I have authority over bombs .
My leaving is permitted , based on the command of the king .

Terry the Tiger Visits the Big City
created and translated by Michael Turniansky
Terry the Tiger lived with his friends Elly the Elephant and Zoe the Zebra in the jungle .
Terry always wanted to visit the big city , where the planes flew overhead to .
So one day , Terry started to walk to the big city .
Soon , Terry came to a river , and asked a fish in it the way to the city .
The fish told Terry he should walk along the river for three days , and then he would see it .
Terry followed its advice
At the end of the third day , Terry saw the city ( Hooray ! ) lights .
O , joy !
Terry decided to continue walking the whole night long .
In the morning , Terry arrived at the marketplace which was at the edge of the city .
There was a boy there .
&quot; Aiee ! A tiger ! &quot; said the boy .
&quot; Aiee ! A boy ! &quot; said the Terry ( for the boy had never seen a tiger before , and Terry had never seen a boy before ) .
The boy , who was Mooli , could tell that Terry was friendly , so he asked Terry if he would like to be shown the city .
&quot; Oh , yes ! But what I really want right now is some sleep . I &apos;m very tired , &quot; said Terry .
&quot; Okay , we can go to my house , &quot; said Mooli .
So the two of them walked to Mooli &apos;s house .
When they got to his house , Mooli asked his mother , &quot; Is it okay if I bring a tiger home ? &quot;
&quot; Sure , Mooli &quot; said his mother
because she thought he was just pretending .
So he brought Terry to his room
and Terry went to sleep on the floor , while Mooli went oustide to play .
A while later , his mother called , &quot; Mooli , time for dinner ... Mooli ? &quot;
She went to Mooli &apos;s room and saw Terry , who was sleeping .
She cried out , &quot; Aaaah ! A tiger has eaten my son ! Police , help ! Help ! Police ! Tiger ! Tiger ! Help ! &quot; and ran out .
The noise woke Terry
He leaped through the window , and ran back to his home in the jungle , promising never again to leave it .
