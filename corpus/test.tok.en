Hi , Alice !
How are you ?
I &apos;m ready to talk .
What will be the weather tomorrow ?
It &apos;ll be sunny , I hope .
Goodbye .
Listening .
Yes . It is an apple .
Can you see the form of the apple ?
Do you think that the apple is ripe ?
Oh , it is smooth .
What about the smell ?
It smells of flowers .
Yum , it tastes sweet .
What happened ?
Do you feel pain ?
It &apos;s not dangerous .
Alice , please , return immediately !
A sound of what ?
Now I feel cold .
I see an apple .
The apple is round .
The apple is colored red .
I hear the sound of a plate that is falling .
I hear something loud .
I hear the tone of the plate falling down .
A music .
An apple that has fallen down .
I smell the odor of flowers .
The apple smells of flowers .
I taste the taste of the apple .
I palpate , touch-feel the apple .
The apple has a smooth surface .
My knee hurts .
I sense the form of an apple .
This is red .
This has the color of blood .
The sun seems to be orange .
Leaves of trees are green .
I look at a woman who wears a violet dress .
The light from the Sun was intense .
What are the news ?
I am frustrated that my brother gets married a girl .
You are not happy that the gets married ?
The girl is poor .
I am not able to explain .
Probably you expect that she doesn &apos;t like the brother .
But the brother smiles every time he talks to her .
I wonder whether the girl likes the brother .
Relax !
But I feel cold .
Yes .
I suggest you go to a doctor .
I assume that I have a cold .
Thanks .
I hit the head and the left hand .
But the right hand doesn &apos;t hurt .
I can see the feet . But I don &apos;t see its toes .
This is Alice .
Pleasure to meet you .
Thanks .
The two children are my offspring .
Karl is the son .
Yeah .
To be precise , I have a brother and a sister .
Your family is large .
I married Susan .
Wow !
Yeah .
What was the price of the car ?
I sold an old car of mine to my friend .
What is the location of your home ?
I live in the country .
I see .
I live near a shop .
